### How to run the files!

To first compile the files, use this in a zsh terminal (or bash) :

g++ -g -O0 -I . -o a3_p2a a3_p2a.cpp

g++ -g -O0 -I . -o a3_p2b a3_p2b.cpp

Then you can run it like this in zsh (or bash too):
./a3_p2a "# of TA's"

./a3_p2b "# of TA's"

And where it says the number of TA's is where you put how many TA's are going to be marking the questions and exams. 
For the rubric file, once you run the program the first time, it will change the rubric (of course it will, its part of the assignment), however if you would like to do a second run,
then you will unfortunately have to rewrite the rubric.txt again as per the assignment instructions initially (or you could continue with whatever the first run stopped at).
